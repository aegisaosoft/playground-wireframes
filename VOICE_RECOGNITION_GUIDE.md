## üì¶ Components

### `useVoiceRecognition` Hook
Custom React hook that wraps the Web Speech API.

```typescript
const {
  isListening,          // Is currently recording
  transcript,           // Final transcript text
  interimTranscript,    // Live transcript (being spoken)
  startListening,       // Start voice recognition
  stopListening,        // Stop voice recognition
  resetTranscript,      // Clear transcript
  isSupported,          // Browser supports voice recognition
  error                 // Error message (if any)
} = useVoiceRecognition({
  continuous: true,     // Keep listening
  interimResults: true, // Show live text
  language: 'en-US'     // Recognition language
});
```

### `VoiceInput` Component
Standalone voice input component with visual feedback.

**Features:**
- Start/Stop recording button
- Live transcript display
- Visual recording indicator (pulsing red button)
- Error notifications

**Usage:**
```tsx
<VoiceInput
  onTranscriptChange={(text) => console.log('Live:', text)}
  onFinalTranscript={(text) => console.log('Final:', text)}
  language="en-US"
/>
```

### `VoiceInputModal` Component
Full-screen modal for voice experience creation.

**Features:**
- Guided voice input
- Example prompts
- AI processing integration
- Cancel/Submit actions

**Usage:**
```tsx
<VoiceInputModal
  isOpen={showModal}
  onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}
  onSubmit={(transcript) => processWithAI(transcript)}
/>
```

### `VoiceExperienceCapture` Component (Enhanced)
Integrated into the experience builder with real voice recognition.

**Features:**
- Multi-modal input (voice, file, link)
- Accumulated recordings
- Transcript editing
- File uploads
- Link pasting

## üöÄ Usage in Experience Builder

### Step 1: User Clicks "Voice Input" Button
The voice experience modal opens.

### Step 2: User Starts Speaking
- Click "Start Voice Input" button
- Browser asks for microphone permission (first time only)
- Red pulsing button indicates recording is active
- Live transcript appears as user speaks

### Step 3: User Stops Recording
- Click "Stop Recording" button
- Final transcript is captured
- User can edit transcript if needed

### Step 4: Process with AI
- Click "Process with AI" button
- Transcript is analyzed
- Experience fields are auto-populated:
  - Title
  - Location (city, country)
  - Dates (start, end)
  - Description
  - Agenda items
  - Ticket tiers
  - Category

## üîê Permissions

### Microphone Access
The browser will request microphone permission:
- **Granted**: Voice recognition works
- **Denied**: Falls back to text input or file upload

### Best Practices
- Request permission only when user clicks voice button
- Show clear instructions before requesting permission
- Provide alternative input methods
- Handle permission errors gracefully

## üí° Example Voice Prompts

### Tech Event
> "I'm hosting a hackathon in San Francisco from March 15th to 17th. It's a 3-day event for developers and designers to build innovative apps. We'll have workshops, mentorship sessions, and demo presentations. Early bird tickets are $99 for 50 spots, and regular tickets are $149 for 100 spots."

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Speech Detected
**Cause**: Microphone not working or ambient noise too low
**Solution**: 
- Check microphone settings
- Speak closer to microphone
- Increase microphone volume

### Microphone Permission Denied
**Cause**: User denied permission or browser blocked it
**Solution**:
- Guide user to browser settings
- Show how to enable microphone
- Offer alternative input methods

### Browser Not Supported
**Cause**: Using older browser or Firefox
**Solution**:
- Show warning message
- Recommend Chrome/Edge/Safari
- Hide voice input option
- Provide text/file alternatives

### Network Error
**Cause**: Google Speech API connection failed
**Solution**:
- Check internet connection
- Retry after a few seconds
- Fall back to text input

## üîß Technical Details

### Web Speech API
Uses the browser's native Speech Recognition API:
- `SpeechRecognition` (Chrome/Edge)
- `webkitSpeechRecognition` (Safari)

### Recognition Options
```javascript
recognition.continuous = true;      // Keep listening
recognition.interimResults = true;  // Show live text
recognition.lang = 'en-US';         // Language
recognition.maxAlternatives = 1;    // Number of alternatives
```

### Events
- `onstart`: Recognition started
- `onresult`: Speech detected
- `onerror`: Error occurred
- `onend`: Recognition ended

### Data Flow
```

  ‚Üì
Interim Results (live)
  ‚Üì
Final Results (confirmed)
  ‚Üì
React State (transcript)
  ‚Üì
UI Display
```

## üìä Performance

### Latency
- **Interim results**: ~200-500ms
- **Final results**: ~1-2 seconds after user stops speaking

### Accuracy
- **Clear speech**: 95-98% accuracy
- **Noisy environment**: 70-85% accuracy
- **Accent handling**: Generally good, varies by accent

### Data Usage
- Minimal data usage
- Only audio data is sent to Google
- No user data is stored

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- Audio is processed by Google's Speech API
- Transcripts are stored locally in React state
- No audio is stored on servers
- No transcripts are sent to third parties

### User Consent
- Microphone permission required
- Clear privacy notice in modal
- User can cancel at any time

## üé® Customization

### Change Language
```typescript
<VoiceInput language="es-ES" />  // Spanish
<VoiceInput language="fr-FR" />  // French
<VoiceInput language="de-DE" />  // German
```

### Styling
All components use Tailwind CSS and can be customized:
```tsx
<VoiceInput className="custom-voice-input" />
```

### Events
```tsx
<VoiceInput
  onTranscriptChange={(text) => {
    // Update live preview
  }}
  onFinalTranscript={(text) => {
    // Process final text
  }}
/>
```
